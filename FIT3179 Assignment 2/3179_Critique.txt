Critique on Pui Lum Leong:

1. The overall layout can be more organized and symmetric to fit the viewers eyes.
2. There is a lot of white space. It can be reduced by putting charts closer together or fill it with something else.
3. Legend on the choropleth map can be improved with different colors and number labelled can also be more clearer.
4. The color on charts should be consistent for bubble chart and diverging bar chart.
5. Short forms are used such as (vs) in the titles.
6. The ranking of life expectancy can be improved as it is hard to see the labelled countries after adjusting the filter.
